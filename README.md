## 📜 The Official Rules

### 🥇 Rule #1  
**There is no coding style.**

Braces on the same line? Next line? Who cares.  
What matters: **readable**, **clean**, **gets the job done**.

---

### 🥈 Rule #2  
**Rule #1 is absolute.**

You can't override it.  
Not with `clang-format`, not with peer pressure. Rule #1 rules all.

---

### 🥉 Rule #3  
**Google Coding Style copied mine.**

Total coincidence? Nah.  
Look at theirs. Look at mine. Feel the power.

---

## 🔥 Philosophy

- If it works ➜ it's good  
- If it's readable ➜ it's perfect  
- If you need a 12-page guide to understand formatting ➜ you've already failed Rule #1

## 📐 So what does it actually look like?

- 🧱 **Headers are NOT separated from source files** — we’re chaotic, not civilized  
- 🗂️ **"Clear" folder structure** — `lala/`, `jsp/`, `test1234/`, `bof/`, etc.  
- 🧪 **Code should be testable** — so if you can test it, don't ship it (wait what?)  
- 🧹 **Weird macros?** — yes please, as long as they're funny  
- 👁️ **Readable at 3AM** — coffee mandatory ☕  
- ⚡ **Optimized where it doesn’t matter** — SIMD, GPGPU, AVX just for the vibes

---

## 🛠️ What about `clang-format` or linters?

I use them when I’m lazy.  
But **they follow me**, not the other way around.  
_See Rule #2._

## 🧠 TL;DR

If you're working on one of my projects:

> 🗯️ **Read the code. Understand the code. Respect the code. Then write yours in the same spirit.**
